# URL Short
A simple URL shortening service, designed to convert longer URLs into concise, unique keys. 
This service provides the capability to use the unique key to access the original URL seamlessly.

## Key Features
- **URL Compression:** The service accepts a URL and generates a unique key representing the corresponding URL.
- **URL Redirection**: Clients are can accessing the original link via the unique key provided to them.
- **CRUD Operations**: Clients can create, read, update and delete their own links.

## High Level Design

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server
    participant Destination Server
    Client ->> Server: visit short URL
    Server ->> Client: HTTP/301 permanent redirect to long URL
    Client ->> Destination Server: redirected to long URL
```

## Low Level Design

1. The client will resolve our load balancer hostname via DNS
2. The load balancer will forward our requests to a series of back end servers
3. If the short URL is already in the cache return its long URL
4. On cache miss look up the long URL from database and store it in the cache
5. Long URL is returned to the user with a HTTP redirect

A breakdown of the API endpoints can be found [here](./doc/endpoints.md)

## Hash Functionality

Keeping the hash length short is important while allowing us to store a large number of unique short URLs. 
A hash length of 7 characters will give us 62^7 (approximately 3.5 trillion) unique short URLs. 
The hash we generate is derived from an MD5 hash of the input string.

### Hash Collision Detection

An essential aspect of our hashing mechanism is collision detection. 
If a collision is detected, a new hash is generated by appending a predefined string to the original 
long URL until a unique hash is created.

```mermaid

    A[Input Long URL] --> B[Hash Function]
    B --> C[Short URL]
    C --> D{Exists In DB?}
    D -->|Yes: Hash Collision| F[Long URL + Predefined String * N]
    D -->|No| E[Save to DB]
    F -->|N + 1| A
```
## Authentication Overview

Authentication is handled through the use of JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
Upon a valid login request to the `/api/v1/login` endpoint, the client receives:
- **Access Token**: Valid for 1 hour, used to access protected endpoints.
- **Refresh Token**: Valid for 60 days, used to obtain a new access token without requiring the user to log in again.

Clients use the access token to access endpoints that require authentication, such as 
`/api/v1/data/shorten`. When the access token expires, the client can obtain a new one from the 
`/api/v1/refresh` endpoint using the refresh token.

Finally, when the refresh token expires, the client must request a new set of tokens
(both access token and refresh token) by logging in again at the `/api/v1/login` endpoint.

The security considerations around the use of JWTs are:
- HTTPs should always be used as a transmission protocol between client and server
- Clients should look to securely store tokens for example using `HttpOnly` cookie (This would be communicated with the front end team).
- Access tokens have a short lifetime and refresh tokens can be revoked from the database. 
- The JWT signing secret my remain secure, I would look to store this in some secret storage platform such as 
Hashicorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server

    Client->>Server: POST /api/v1/login (credentials)
    Server-->>Client: access token (1 hour) & refresh token (60 days)

    Client->>Server: POST /api/v1/data/shorten (access token)
    Server-->>Client: Data

    Note over Client: access token expires

    Client->>Server: POST /api/v1/refresh (refresh token)
    Server-->>Client: new access token (1 hour)

    Note over Client: refresh token expires
```
